# Foundamentals of Probability

Three fundamental principles of Probability:
1. $P \geq 0$
2. $\sum P = 1$
3. $P(AB) = P(A)P(B)$ if A and B are independent events

## Space and Events
 
- Sample Space $\Omega$: The set of outcomes depends on the problem being studied. 
- Event Space $\mathcal{F}$: consists of all combinations of outcomes to which probabilities can be assigned

## Sets

- Intersection
- Union
- Complement
- Mutually Exclusive
