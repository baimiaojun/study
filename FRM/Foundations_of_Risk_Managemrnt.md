# Risk Management Framework（公司内部的风险管理流程）

## concepts of risk

uncertainty: 
- may be loss as well as gains, mix of danger and opportunity
- the  possibility of bad things might happen

1. Risk management(风险管理): firms select the type and level of risk that is appropriate for them to assume（承担）
2. Risk taking(投机): assume additional risk actively for additional gains (主动承担更多的风险以获得更大的收益)

## Risk management building Blocks (十大模块)

1. Risk management process 风险管理过程
  - identify: 识别风险类型等(knowns 已知风险/ unknowns 未知风险 ) 
    - EL(Expected Loss: variable cost or predictable expense): 预期损失 the avg loss expected to take  e.g. bad debt, spread
    - UL(Unexpected Loss)：非预期损失 depart from the avg (和平均值偏离的部分，难以预测和评估的) e.g. natural disaster, unflavored events happen together(correlation risk) 不好的事情一起发生 
    - tail loss: 尾部风险
  - Analyze: 量化分析风险
  - Assess impact: 评估风险带来的影响
  - Manage: 管理的手段(Avoid避免风险/retain保留风险/mitigate缓释降低风险/transfer转移风险)
  
2. Risk factor breakdown and interaction: 风险分解 e.g. EL = EAD * LGD * PD
3. Structual change: from tail loss to systemic crisis  EVT(Exterem value Theroy 极值理论 评估尾部风险)
4. Human agency and conflicts of interest 利益冲突 
5. Typology of risks and risk interactions
6. Risk aggregation 风险整合： VaR(Value at Risk)
7. Balancing risk and reward (trade-off 权衡): risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) = Reward / Risk
8. Enterprise risk management(ERM) 全面风险管理

## Typology of risks and risk interactions 
### Market Risk

1. price volatility is the engine of market risk, depending on underlying asset(标的资产)

- equity risk 股票风险
- interest rate risk 利率风险
- currency risk 通货风险
- commodity price risk 商品价格风险

2. market risk is driven by:
- general market risk: an asset class will fall in value
- specific market risk: an individual asset will fall in value

3. market risk can be managed through the relationships between positions ( the diversification benefits of a large equity portfolio), also arises from these relationships.

### Credit Risk

1. the failure of one party to fulfill(履行) its financial obligations(债务) to another party.

2. driven by 
- the probability of default of the obligor(债务人) or counterparty(交易对手)
- exposure amount
- the amount that can be recovered
3. e.g. bankruptcy risk 破产风险（资不抵债）, downgrade risk 降级风险, counterparty risk 对手方风险(settlement risk 结算风险、Herstatt risk 跨国货币的结算风险)

### Liquidity Risk

1. two quite separate  kinds of risk:
- funding liquidity risk: a firm can not access enough liquid cash and assets to meet its obligations （没钱又借不到钱）
- market liquidity risk(trading liquidity risk): a loss in asset value when markets temporarily seize up(市场暂时失灵) （卖不掉）

### Operational Risk

risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.

### Business and Strategic Risk

### Reputation risk 声誉风险

## Process of Risk Management

 1. identify risk appetite 识别风险偏好
   - the amount and types of risk a firm is willing to accept
   - can be  expressed in quantitative(定量) or qualitative(定性) statements
   - in constrast to risk capacity (the max amount of risk a firm can absorb)
   - determining the risk management(The board)
     - The board (由董事会来决定 risk appetite)communicate with management 
     - there must be a logical relationship between the firm’s risk appetite and its business strategy必须和业务战略相一致
     - must consider the potential conflict between debt holders(比较保守) and shareholders(更加愿意冒险) 必须考虑到债主和股东之间的利益关系
     - the role of the board  in determining(set the objectives --> set the criteria in advance --> deckare to hedge accounting profit or economic profits and short-term profits or long-term profits --> clarify the time horizon)
 2. mapping the risk(绘制风险图谱), make choice 可视化风险以做出更好的选择
     - chosing instruments for risk management(Exchange traded 场内交易工具(option 一部分期权， 如上证50ETF, futures) or over the counter(OTC) 场外交易(Forward 远期, swap互换, option 一部分期权))
 4. Operationalize risk appetite 实施风险偏好
 5. Implement 实现
 6. Re-evaluate regularly to capture changes 再评估

## Cons and Pros of Hedging 风险对冲的同意与反对（优缺点）

2. Monitoring risk


1. Risk management committee 风险管理委员会
    - set the firm’s  risk appetite and independently review the governance of all material risk
    - responsible for : 
      - identify, measure and monitor finanical risks

#### Risk advisory director (RAD)风险专家顾问（董事会成员）

- is a board member and a risk specialist who attends risk committee and audit committee

#### Chief risk officer (CRO) （高管）
- establish an ERM(全面风险管理) approach
- report to CEO or CFO, but dotted-line to the board(如果CEO或者CFO有问题，可以直接向board汇报)

### interdependence of functional units
- need to work together
- all transaction data must be recorded correctly(operations unit is extremely inportance to record data)
