# Risk Management Framework（公司内部的风险管理流程）

## concepts of risk

uncertainty: 
- may be loss as well as gains, mix of danger and opportunity
- the  possibility of bad things might happen

1. Risk management(风险管理): firms select the type and level of risk that is appropriate for them to assume（承担）
2. Risk taking(投机): assume additional risk actively for additional gains (主动承担更多的风险以获得更大的收益)

## Risk management building Blocks (十大模块)

1. Risk management process 风险管理过程
  - identify: 识别风险类型等(knowns 已知风险/ unknowns 未知风险 ) 
    - EL(Expected Loss: variable cost or predictable expense): 预期损失 the avg loss expected to take  e.g. bad debt, spread
    - UL(Unexpected Loss)：非预期损失 depart from the avg (和平均值偏离的部分，难以预测和评估的) e.g. natural disaster, unflavored events happen together(correlation risk) 不好的事情一起发生 
    - tail loss: 尾部风险
  - Analyze: 量化分析风险
  - Assess impact: 评估风险带来的影响
  - Manage: 管理的手段(Avoid避免风险/retain保留风险/mitigate缓释降低风险/transfer转移风险)
  
2. Risk factor breakdown and interaction: 风险分解 e.g. EL = EAD * LGD * PD
3. Structual change: from tail loss to systemic crisis  EVT(Exterem value Theroy 极值理论 评估尾部风险)
4. Human agency and conflicts of interest 利益冲突 
5. Typology of risks and risk interactions
6. Risk aggregation 风险整合： VaR(Value at Risk)
7. Balancing risk and reward (trade-off 权衡): risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) = Reward / Risk
8. Enterprise risk management(ERM) 全面风险管理

## Typology of risks and risk interactions 
### Market Risk

1. price volatility is the engine of market risk, depending on underlying asset(标的资产)

- equity risk 股票风险
- interest rate risk 利率风险
- currency risk 通货风险
- commodity price risk 商品价格风险

2. market risk is driven by:
- general market risk: an asset class will fall in value
- specific market risk: an individual asset will fall in value

3. market risk can be managed through the relationships between positions ( the diversification benefits of a large equity portfolio), also arises from these relationships.

### Credit Risk

1. the failure of one party to fulfill(履行) its financial obligations(债务) to another party.

2. driven by 
- the probability of default of the obligor(债务人) or counterparty(交易对手)
- exposure amount
- the amount that can be recovered
3. e.g. bankruptcy risk 破产风险（资不抵债）, downgrade risk 降级风险, counterparty risk 对手方风险(settlement risk 结算风险、Herstatt risk 跨国货币的结算风险)

### Liquidity Risk

1. two quite separate  kinds of risk:
- funding liquidity risk: a firm can not access enough liquid cash and assets to meet its obligations （没钱又借不到钱）
- market liquidity risk(trading liquidity risk): a loss in asset value when markets temporarily seize up(市场暂时失灵) （卖不掉）

### Operational Risk

risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.

### Business and Strategic Risk

### Reputation risk 声誉风险

# How do firms manage finanal risk

## Process of Risk Management

 1. identify risk appetite 识别风险偏好
   - the amount and types of risk a firm is willing to accept
   - can be  expressed in quantitative(定量) or qualitative(定性) statements
   - in constrast to risk capacity (the max amount of risk a firm can absorb)
   - determining the risk management(The board)
     - The board (由董事会来决定 risk appetite)communicate with management 
     - there must be a logical relationship between the firm’s risk appetite and its business strategy必须和业务战略相一致
     - must consider the potential conflict between debt holders(比较保守) and shareholders(更加愿意冒险) 必须考虑到债主和股东之间的利益关系
     - the role of the board  in determining(set the objectives --> set the criteria in advance --> deckare to hedge accounting profit or economic profits and short-term profits or long-term profits --> clarify the time horizon)
 2. mapping the risk(绘制风险图谱), make choice 可视化风险以做出更好的选择
     - chosing instruments for risk management(Exchange traded 场内交易工具(option 一部分期权， 如上证50ETF, futures) or over the counter(OTC) 场外交易(Forward 远期, swap互换, option 一部分期权))
 4. Operationalize risk appetite 实施风险偏好
 5. Implement 实现
 6. Re-evaluate regularly to capture changes 再评估

## Cons and Pros of Hedging 风险对冲的同意与反对（优缺点）

1. Disadvantages
  - active hedging may distract management from its core business 分散管理层在核心业务上的注意力
  - risk management requires specialized skills, knowledge...
  - a flawed risk management can drag a firm down even more quickly 错误的风险管理可能使公司陷入更大的困境
  - even a well-developed risk management strategy has complance cost 存在一些成本
2. advantages
  - reduce the cost of capital by reducing the volatility of earning or cash flow 减少融资成本，因为公司表现好，更好融资
  - indicate that management is doing a good job, reflected directly in the firm’s stock price反应管理层的工作做的很好
  - allow management better control over the firm’s economic performance
  - derivatives instruments may be cheaper than purchasing an insurance policy
  - hedging may offers synergies(协同) with the operations of the firm 对冲做的好可以和公司其他业务协同变好
 
 
# The Governance of Risk Management 风险管理的治理

## Corporate Governance 公司治理

- the way in which companies are run, describes the role and reponsibilities of a firm’s shareholders, board of directors and senior management
- manage the conflicting intereests between shareholders and other stakeholders
- best practice行业最高操作标准
    - The board keeps independent from the management
    - The board looks after the interests of all stakeholders
    - The board develops a clear business strategy and make sure that risks are made transparent to stakeholders
    - The board should be careful of potential agency risk(management may take more risks to max personal benefits)
    - The board should consider the introduction of a chief risk offer(CRO 高管)
    - The board should demand substance over form 实质大于形式 （focus on the firm’s econcmic performance）
    - The board promotes a robust risk management process
    - The board set up an ethics committee道德委员会 and establish strong ethical standards
    - Board make sure that the way staff are rewarded and compensated is based on risk-adjusted performance
    - Board approves all major transactions
    - Board has a risk committee 风险委员会, separate from the audit committe 审计委员会
    - Board makes sure a firm’s risk management plan aligns risk appetite with business strategy
   
 
## Mechanisms of Risk Governance 风险治理的机制

### Risk management in corporate governance(risk governance)
- set up an organizationa infrastructure 设置治理框架
- transparency: establish channels of communication
1. risk appetite and limit policies(market risk and credit risk limit)
2. Monitoring risk


1. Risk management committee 风险管理委员会
    - set the firm’s  risk appetite and independently review the governance of all material risk
    - responsible for : 
      - identify, measure and monitor finanical risks
      - approve credit facilities
      - monitors the composition of a bank’s lending and investment portfolios in light of the current economic environment
2. Audit committee 审计委员会
    - is accountable from the accuracy and completeness of a firm’s financial and regulatory disclosures, the firm’s compliance with the best practice standards in non-financial matters
    - are required to be financial literate 专家
    - be independent but productive(保持一致) with the management
3. Compensation committee 薪酬委员会 (for management)
    - keep independent of management
    - be aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders, and with risk-adjusted return on capital RAROC


#### Risk advisory director (RAD)风险专家顾问（董事会成员）

- is a board member and a risk specialist who attends risk committee and audit committee

#### Chief risk officer (CRO) （高管）
- establish an ERM(全面风险管理) approach
- report to CEO or CFO, but dotted-line to the board(如果CEO或者CFO有问题，可以直接向board汇报)

### interdependence of functional units
- need to work together
- all transaction data must be recorded correctly(operations unit is extremely inportance to record data)


## Credit Risk Transfer Machanisms 信用风险转移机制

The core risk exposure for banks is credit risk.

### method
- purchasing insurance from a third-party guarantor
- netting of exposures to counterparties 净额结算
- market to market/margining 逐日盯市
- requiring collateral be posted 抵押品（存在wrong-way risk 雪上加霜）
- Termination(终止) / Put option(看跌期权)
- Reassignment of a credit exposure to another party

### short comings
- require specific agreement
- may not easily fit the need/goals
- don’t isolate隔离 the credit risk from the underlying positions
- do not effectively “slice and dice” (切片、切块)risk 风险消失，收益也消失（一刀切）

### novel credit derivatives 信用衍生品

novel credit derivatives and securitizations 资产证券化

intruments:
- credit default swaps(CDSs)
- collateralized debt obligations(CDOs)
- collateralized loan obligations(CLOs)

advantages:
- credit price discovery 信用价格发现 开发了信用衍生品市场 robust,liquid, transparent
- CDS (信用产品的保险) price (保费) offer a means to monitor default risks （保费的变化体现了信用风险的大小）
- off-balance sheet instrument 表外工具（不用卖掉标的资产，只需要交易信用衍生品，就可以缓释风险）
- fine tuning of thr vredit portfolio and positions

disadvantages:
- should understand the full nature of the risk transfer(需要具备一定的知识)
- need to understand when the contract is enforceable and when it is not
- systemic concentration risk 风险集中

### The mechanics of securitization 资产证券化
repackaging of loans and other assets into new securities that can be sold in the securities market

- special purpose vehicle (SPV)
- from traditional buy-and-hold strategy to a new originate-to-distribute(OTD) 贷款再分配 business model

benefits of OTD
- Originators(banks): greater capital efficiency 提高资本效率and enhanced funding opportunities 增加投资机会and lower earnings volatility 降低盈利波动性
- Investors: a wider array of investments 投资选择面变广 , better sync their risk/return profiles with their goals and preference 更好匹配风险偏好
- Borrowers: the expansion of available credit and product options,lower borrowing costs贷款选择变多，且导致利率下降

erosion of OTS 缺点
- moral hazard 道德风险

The issues needed to be addressed:
- misaligned incentives along the securitization chain, driven by the pursuit of short-term profits 在追求短期利润的驱动下，证券化链上的激励机制不一致
- the risk embedded in securitized products were not transparent
- poor securitization risk management 风险管理做的不够
- an overreliance on the accuracy and transparency of credit ratings


# Portfolio Management

## Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and Capital Asset Pricing Model

### MPT

均值-方差分析框架（均值：期望收益率， 方差：风险）

1. Assumption of MPT
  - Captial markets are perfect
    - There are no taxes or transaction costs
    - All traders have costless(不需要费用) access to all available information
    - Perfect competition exists among all market participants(完全竞争，不存在垄断)
  - Returns are normally distributed
2. Measurements of return
  - Average return (Arithmetic return) 算术平均值 $R = (R_1 + ... + R_n) / n$
3. Measurements of risk
  - Population variance $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(X_i - \mu)^2}{N}$
  - Sample variance $s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \overline X)^2}{n-1}$
4. Utility Theory
  - Behavior of investors under uncertainty
    - Risk averse (风险厌恶): minimize the risk for the same amount of return and maximize the return for the same amount of risk (rational investor), prefer a higher mean return and a lower variance(A > 0)
    - Risk neutral (风险中性): maximize return irrespective of risk (不考虑风险)(A = 0)
    - Risk seeking(风险偏好): maximize both risk and return (A < 0)
  - Utility function 
    - $U = E(R) - \frac{1}{2}A\sigma^2$(A = a measure of risk aversion)
    - A measure to rank different portfolios in the order of tgeir preference
    - quantify the rankings of investment choices using risk and return 
    - Indifference curve (无差别曲线): the combinations of risk-return pairs that an investor would accept tp maintain a given level of utility(无差别曲线上的点对应的效用是一致的)
      - For  a risk-averse investor, the curves are upward sloping and convex(get steeper) because of diminishing marginal utility of return (边际效用递减)
      - For various types of investors, the more risk-averse the investor, the steeper the curve
5. Efficient Frontier (有效前沿)
  - Return and risk of portfolio with two risky assets
    - Return : $R_p = w_1R_1 + w_2R_2$
    - Risk: $\sigma_p = \sqrt{w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2Cov(R_1, R_2)} = \sqrt{w_1^2\sigma_1^2 + w_2^2\sigma_2^2 + 2w_1w_2\rho_{1,2}\sigma_1\sigma_2}$
    - risk decreases as the assets are becoming less correlated
  - Efficient Frontier: All attainable portfolios with all risky assets
    - minimum-variance frontier of risky assets
    - global minimum-variance portfolio
    - efficient frontier (also called Markowitz efficient frontier)
6. Optimal portfolio selection: the tangent(切点) point of indifference curve to efficient frontier

### CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model)

1. Capital market theory

each investor’s portfolio is just a combination of risky assets and risk-free asset

2. Capital asset pricing model (CAPM)

break down the risk of an individual asset into specific risk(特定风险) and systematic risk (系统性风险)

3. Capital allocation line (CAL) 资本分配线

$R_p = w_{risky}R_{risky} + w_{risk-free}R_{risk-free}$
$\sigma_p = w_{risk}\sigma_{risky}$

CAL的斜率：sharpe ratio

- CAL(P) is the optimal CAL, which is tangent to efficient frontier of risky assets

4. Capital market line (CML)

- assuming all investors have a homogeneous expection (一致的预期)：same CAL and same efficient frontier (call the same CAL: CML Capital market line): mrket portfolio
- market portfolio: CML is tangent to the efficient frontoer at a point
- market portfolio: includes all of the risky assets in the economy weighted by their relative market values(按照市值比例作为权重的所有风险资产组合) 
- CML: $E(R_p) = R_f + \frac{E(R_m) - R_f}{\sigma_m}\sigma_p$
- CML is the efficient frontier for all assets (include risky assets and risk-free assets)

5. Systematic risk & Unsystematic risk 系统性风险和非系统性风险
- Systematic risk(non-diversifiable risk or market risk): the risk affects the entire market or economy, cannot be avoided and inherent(固有的) in the overall market. e.g. macro factors
- only be rewarded for bearing  Systematic risk not for bearing Unsystematic risk
- Unsystematic risk(firm-specific risk or idiosyncratic risk) : can be reduced by holding well-diversified portfolios

6. $Beta(\beta)$
- Systematic risk can be measure by  $Beta(\beta)$ of asset, reppresenting how sensitive an asse’s return is to the market
- From an investor’s perspective, $\beta$ represents Systematic risk
- $\beta_i = \frac{cov(R_i, R_m)}{\sigma_{mkt}^2} = \frac{\rho_{i,m}\sigma_i\sigma_m}{\sigma_m^2} = \rho_{i,m}\frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}$
- take on positive or negative values

7. Auusmptions of CAPM
- investors are expected to make decisions only in terms of expected values and standard deviations of the returns
- investor plan for the same single holding period (只对未来一期做预测)
- infinitely divisible 资产无限可分，任意比例分配
- no transaction cost and no tax, or other freictions
- short sale is allowed unlimitedly 想做空就可以做空
- all participants can borrow and lend at a common risk-free rate 
- investor have homogeneous expectations or beliefs
- any individual investor’s allocation decision cannot change the market prices
- All assets, including human capital(人力资产), are tradable

8. Components of CAPM
$$E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i[E(R_m) - R_f]$$
- $E(R_m) - R_f$: market portfolio risk premium(风险溢价)
- Rewriting: $E(R_i) = R_f + \sigma_i\rho_{i,m}[E(R_m) - R_f]$

9. Security market line (SML)证券市场线
- 均衡市场 the market in equilibrium， 投资者无法获得超额收益 , all securities will lie on the Security market line
- security selection (properly priced(on SML), overpriced(below SML), underpriced(above SML))

10. CML vs. SML

## Performance Measures

### Sharpe Performance Index (SPI) 夏普比率

$SPI = \frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\sigma_i}$

- 分子： mean excess return 超额回报
- 分母： standard deviation （总风险）
- the higher is better
- the slope of CAL

### Treynor Performance Index (TPI) 特雷诺比率

$TPI = \frac{E(R_i) - R_f}{\beta_i}$

- 分子： mean excess return 超额回报
- 分母： Beta (系统性风险)
- the higher is better
- the slope of SML
- in CAPM: $TPI = E(R_m) - R_f$ 
- $E(R_m) - R_f$ are also called the alpha measure
- for well-diversified portfolios

### Jensen’s Performance Index (JPI) : Jensen’s $\alpha$

$\alpha_i = R_i - [R_f + \beta(R_m - R_f)]$

- the difference between actual return and return required to compensate for systematic risk (CAPM)
- for well-diversified portfolios
- 变形后: $TPI = \alpha \frac{1}{\beta_i} + (R_m - R_f)$

### Sortino Ratio 索提诺(SR)

$SR = \frac{R_p - T}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^N min(0, R_{pt}-T)^2}}$

- a modification of SPI
- focus on downside risk 注重亏损的部分
- 分母：downside deviation 半标准差, the standard deviation of negative returns
- T: target or required rate of return (minimum accepted rate MAR)

### Tracking Error 跟踪误差(TE)

$TE = \sigma_{R_p - R_b}$

- the standard deviation of return difference between the portfolio and the benchmark
- $R_b$: benchmark

### Information Ratio 信息比率(IR)

$IR = \frac{E(R_p) - E(R_b)}{\sigma_{R_p - R_b}}$

## The Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Multifactor Models of Risk and Return

### Arbitrage Pricing Theory 套利定价理论

1. CAPM vs. APT

- CAPM asserts that the expected return on any asset is determined by its exposure (known as beta) to only one systematic risk factor(market risk)
- CAPM assumption: all investors have a homogeneous expection 
- APT asserts that the expected return on any asset is determined by its exposure one or more systematic risk factors
- CAPM can be regarded as a special case of APT
- APT only auusumes that there are no arbitrage opportunities

2. Auusmption of APT
- Security returns can be described by a factor model and can be explained by systemic factors
- there are sufficient securities to diversify away ynsystematic risk 
- there are no arbitrage opportunities, if any arbitrage opportunities were to exist, investors would exploit them away
- don’t assume investors hold efficient portfolios and don’t assume risk averse

3. formula
$$E(R_p) = R_f + \bets_{p,1}(\lambda_1) + \bets_{p,2}(\lambda_2) + ... + \bets_{p,k}(\lambda_k)$$

- $\beta_{p, j}$: the sensitivity of the portfolio to factor j
- $\lambda_j$: the factor risk premium fro factor j (超额)
- Pure factor portfolio: a portfolio with sensitivity of 1 to factor j and sensitivity of 0 to all other factors: can be used to hedge exposures to multiple factors

4. APT
- The law of price (一价定律)： if two assets are equivalent in all economically relevant respects, then they should have the same market price
- Arbitrage opportunity arises when an investor can earn riskless profits without making a net investment

5. Fama-French three factor model
- sysmatic factors: market index, firm size(market capitalization) and book-to-market ratio
- $R_i - R_F = \alpha_i + \beta_{i,M}(R_M - R_f) + \beta_{i, SMB}SMB + \beta_{i,HML}HML + e_i$
- $SMB$: Small Minus Big, i.e., the return of a portfolio of small stocks in excess of the return on a portfolio of large stocks
- $HML$: High Minus Low, i.e., he return of a portfolio of stocks with a high book-to-market ratio(value stock 价值股) in excess of the return on a portfolio of stocks with a low book-to-market ratio(growth stock 成长股、垃圾股)
- $\alpha_i$: the residual return of asset i after controlling for the three factors
- $e_i$: random data

### Multifactor Model

measure asset return and manage exposure to economy-wide risk factors(i.e. GDP, inflation)

$$R_i = E(R_i) + \beta_{i, 1}F_1 + \beta_{i, 2}F_2 + ... + \beta_{i, k}F_k + e_i$$

- $R_i$: return on asset i
- $E(R_i)$: expected return on asset i
- $\beta_{i,j}$: beta for factor j on asset i
- $F_j$: deviation of  factor j from its expected value value(surprise)
- $e_i$: firm-spectfic return for asset i (residual)

# Enterprise Risk anagement(ERM 全面风险管理) and Future Trend

## Traditional approach to risk management

- manage risk in organizational silos (market, credit and operational risks were treated separately)
- short coming: 
    - risk are highly interdependent(independent) and cannot be segmented
    - result in inefficient and costly
    - various business units may use different methods and models, top management and the board may not easy to understand

## Introduction of Enterprise Risk anagement(ERM 全面风险管理) 

### The feature of ERM

- comprehensive and intergrated(一体化), enterprise-level view of risk 
- top-down 自上而下
- focus on the largest threats

### Benefits of ERM

### motivation to adopt ERM

- top to bottom --vertical vision 垂直视角
- concentrations of risk within the firm
- thinking beyond Silos
- Relevant insurance (don’t insure the kettle)

### five dimensions of ERM

- Targets: risk appetite snd how it relates to its strategic goals
- Structure 组织架构
- Identification and Metrics 风险识别和度量工具 （关键）
- Strategies
- Culture

### risk culture
- internal culture indicator
- external factors
- challenges to the risk culture

### Scenario analysis: ERM’s sharpest blade 情景分析和压力测试 stress test
