# Risk Management Framework（公司内部的风险管理流程）

## concepts of risk

uncertainty: 
- may be loss as well as gains, mix of danger and opportunity
- the  possibility of bad things might happen

1. Risk management(风险管理): firms select the type and level of risk that is appropriate for them to assume（承担）
2. Risk taking(投机): assume additional risk actively for additional gains (主动承担更多的风险以获得更大的收益)

## Risk management building Blocks (十大模块)

1. Risk management process 风险管理过程
  - identify: 识别风险类型等(knowns 已知风险/ unknowns 未知风险 ) 
    - EL(Expected Loss: variable cost or predictable expense): 预期损失 the avg loss expected to take  e.g. bad debt, spread
    - UL(Unexpected Loss)：非预期损失 depart from the avg (和平均值偏离的部分，难以预测和评估的) e.g. natural disaster, unflavored events happen together(correlation risk) 不好的事情一起发生 
    - tail loss: 尾部风险
  - Analyze: 量化分析风险
  - Assess impact: 评估风险带来的影响
  - Manage: 管理的手段(Avoid避免风险/retain保留风险/mitigate缓释降低风险/transfer转移风险)
  
2. Risk factor breakdown and interaction: 风险分解 e.g. EL = EAD * LGD * PD
3. Structual change: from tail loss to systemic crisis  EVT(Exterem value Theroy 极值理论 评估尾部风险)
4. Human agency and conflicts of interest 利益冲突 
5. Typology of risks and risk interactions
6. Risk aggregation 风险整合： VaR(Value at Risk)
7. Balancing risk and reward (trade-off 权衡): risk adjusted return on capital (RAROC) = Reward / Risk
8. Enterprise risk management(ERM) 全面风险管理

## Typology of risks and risk interactions 
### Market Risk

1. price volatility is the engine of market risk, depending on underlying asset(标的资产)

- equity risk 股票风险
- interest rate risk 利率风险
- currency risk 通货风险
- commodity price risk 商品价格风险

2. market risk is driven by:
- general market risk: an asset class will fall in value
- specific market risk: an individual asset will fall in value

3. market risk can be managed through the relationships between positions ( the diversification benefits of a large equity portfolio), also arises from these relationships.

### Credit Risk

1. the failure of one party to fulfill(履行) its financial obligations(债务) to another party.

2. driven by 
- the probability of default of the obligor(债务人) or counterparty(交易对手)
- exposure amount
- the amount that can be recovered
3. e.g. bankruptcy risk 破产风险（资不抵债）, downgrade risk 降级风险, counterparty risk 对手方风险(settlement risk 结算风险、Herstatt risk 跨国货币的结算风险)

### Liquidity Risk

1. two quite separate  kinds of risk:
- funding liquidity risk: a firm can not access enough liquid cash and assets to meet its obligations （没钱又借不到钱）
- market liquidity risk(trading liquidity risk): a loss in asset value when markets temporarily seize up(市场暂时失灵) （卖不掉）

### Operational Risk

risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.

### Business and Strategic Risk

### Reputation risk 声誉风险
